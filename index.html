	<h2> BEING GREEN</h2>
		<h4>

We use soy-based inks to ensure our publishing is environmentally friendly.</h4><p>
		 The soy-based ink allows for fewer harsh chemicals to be used. The printing process is not able to use water soluble and biodegradable procedures. All of our paper products are recycled paper production.</p>

<section id="col1" class="threecols2 fltLt border ">
	<h2>QUICK PRINTING</h2>
		<h4>Using the latest technology in the area, we are able to complete projects quickly and efficiently. </h4>
		<p>We can set up our printers to produce quality, professional designs and printed products. We do not allow our efficiency to become ‘hasty’ or sloppy, only professional quality products at a time sensitive delivery.</p>
</section>
<section id="col2" class="threecols3 fltLt border ">
	<h2>CONFIDENTIALITY </h2>
		<h4> We keep your information confidential. </h4> <p>Legal communities need products copied, bound, and reproduced periodically. We understand how important it is to keep the information we hand confidential.</p>

<h1> WHO ARE WE?</h1>
<h3>Andrea and Henry Senderson</h3>
<img src="images/couple.jpg"

<p>After earning his Masters degree in Mass Communications, Henry Senderson joined the Peace Corp to see the world outside Monson, Maine. It was in southern France where he met his two loves, publishing, and a young girl, his future wife Andrea. After marrying two years later, the couple returned to Maine to buy a publishing company from a family friend. The rest is history.</p>

<h1>WHY US?</h1><h3> Why Not Buy Printing Locally?</h3>
<img src="images/sign.jpg"
width="150" height ="180" alt="Send the Right Impression" />

<p>A growing body of economic research shows that in an increasingly homogenized world, entrepreneurs and skilled workers are more likely to invest – and settle – in communities that preserve one-of-a-kind, locally owned businesses.</p>
